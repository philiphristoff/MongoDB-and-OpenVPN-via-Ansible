# MongoDB-and-OpenVPN-via-Ansible
This repo will contain my solutions to a practical task I received as part of candidacy process.
The requirements are as follows:
- Set up an Ubuntu VM (e.g. with Vagrant or in the Cloud) with a running Mongo db using an Ansible playbook.
- Set up a second Ubuntu VM which should regularly store backups of the Mongo db in the first VM using an Ansible playbook.
- Set up a VPN server (with Ansible) in one VM and connect to it from the other.
